# Implementing Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for Job Reassignment Problem
### Project in progress
This repository has the implementation and results of my bachelor thesis in Computer Science, currently been developed. The goal is to implement Job Reassignment Problem in QAOA, using OpenQAOA framework. A ~100 random instances sample is taken, and some analysis over the algorithm performance is done.
