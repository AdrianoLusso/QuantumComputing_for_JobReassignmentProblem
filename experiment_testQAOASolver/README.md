#  experiment_testQAOASolver

This experiment will make use of the workflow of 'testQAOASolver' to run different instances of JRP and get different theoretic and industrial metrics to analyze. Two sub-experiments will be done:

* **test**: a first test experiment. This just for testing the entire workflow and analyze the structure of json outputs it has. It is a good idea to look at it to do fast test and understanding all what involves the workflow

* **real**: TODO
